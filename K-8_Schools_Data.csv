Students discover their passions by being exposed to the visual and performing arts and other cultural riches that contribute to the development of the whole child. Additionally, students collaborate with teams of teachers who provide them with academic and personal support. Students engage in programming designed to stimulate, provoke, and develop their imagination. Students' work is exhibited in a museum-like way during our biannual Dream. Think. Do! Gallery Tour.

Our upper grades are fully integrated within our highly successful K-8 school. With only two classes per grade, the relationship between students and teachers is personal and supportive. This smaller population fosters a strong sense of community. Guided by educators who recognize the needs of children with outstanding intellectual potential, we provide intimate, differentiated, and departmentalized instruction that encourages critical thinking, creative problem-solving, divergent thinking, research, independent study, collaboration, and self-evaluation.

The school prepares students for professional music careers while recognizing that not every student will choose such a career. The underlying philosophy of the Special Music School is the belief that music education for gifted pupils requires: 1) extensive opportunities to work one-to-one with an outstanding instrumental faculty; 2) a structured, sequential music curriculum; 3) opportunities to perform before audiences; and 4) interaction between general academics and musical studies. Our goal is to see each child reach his or her academic and musical potential. Our vision is that all students will become lifelong learners and critical thinkers in our caring and respectful learning environment.

We are the recipients of numerous awards for excellence on city and state assessments and our Eighth-grade students are accepted into prestigious specialized screened and private high schools. We offer our students Regents courses in Living Environment Science, Integrated Algebra Math, and Spanish Proficiency for high school credit. Through grant funding, we have three 'state of the art' science labs, grade-assigned laptops and iPads. Our students benefit from numerous partnerships throughout the city including Urban Advantage, Mount Sinai Hospital, Columbia University, New York Cares, Carmel Hill, DREAM, BEAM, and Harlem Center.

In addition, we believe that creating and providing innovative, personalized learning environments that work in tandem with the real world of their greater community will best serve our children. All students have access to technology during the school day and at our After-School and Saturday Academy.

We are not a zoned, community school and 85% of our students are bussed to the school by either the Office of Pupil Transportation or private busses that are funded by the families that use them.  We are deeply committed to a strong sense of community based on Tribes Agreements, Responsive Classroom approaches and our middle school advisory program.

We believe that all students must be provided with rigorous, individualized instruction, as well as challenging materials rooted in non-fiction texts, in order to become college and career ready. We believe that by providing our students with rigorous instruction rooted in the NYS Common Core Standards, our students will meet challenges that lie ahead in a competitive collegiate and career-minded world.

We are a small school, but we span Grades PK-8. At our school, there is a 1:13 teacher-to-student ratio, which enables students and staff members to build strong relationships. Due to our small size and low teacher-to-student ratio, the school community is characterized by a true family spirit. We are called The Magnet School of Global Studies & Leadership. Our mission is create learning experiences that will inspire students to become thoughtful global citizens. Students in Grades 6-8 study global issues and consider ways in which they can make a difference at a young age. In addition to core subjects, our middle school students can learn about photography, chess, forensics, American Sign Language, and more.

Teachers, students, and families are dedicated. We practice the concept of social justice, which we translate to mean Equity Access, maximum inclusion for all. This is reflected in how we build our classes, organize all activities, and ensure that every student has access to all the school has to offer. Nearly all of our students take two Regents and our high passing rate reflects high expectations and high achievement for all students. The process starts for many of our students in Pre-K and we welcome new students all along the way to eighth grade graduation! Parents appreciate how our school provides a challenging curriculum within a small learning community that promotes positive behavior. Our collaborative teams work together to set goals, plan for effective instruction, and monitor and assess student performance. The skills and strategies that students gain enable them to attain success and reach their potential. Our skilled staff supports families in many ways. Parents feel that the school creates a physically and emotionally secure environment in which everyone can focus on student learning.

Additionally, our Amplify Science curriculum is lab oriented and combines hands-on and technology-driven lessons that maximize students' learning opportunities. Our approach to math instruction includes a balance of authentic, real-world tasks and hands-on differentiated work. By the Eighth grade, all students are prepared for access to the Algebra I and Living Environment Regents.

We value our partnerships with Midori & Friends Inc., Studio in a School, and ArtsPower.

By addressing the needs of all students, including our students with special needs, English Language Learners, and gifted students, the SEM Model engages all of the children in visual, musical, spatial, and kinesthetic activities through their interests and talents thereby enabling them to enhance their academic potential.",Hunters Point,"48-09 Center Boulevard, Queens, NY 11109",Fully Accessible,718-392-5402,,{'url': 'https://www.myschools.nyc/en/schools/middle-school/12592'},G to 21st St; 7 to Vernon Blvd-Jackson Ave,"B32, B62, Q67",Q078Z,P.S./I.S. 78Q,Zoned,77,8,1,1,13,77,N,N,Open to continuing 5th grade students and students residing in the elementary school zone,Priority to continuing students,Then to residents of the elementary school zone,100,64,61,Academy of American Studies,,85,748,PK-8,8:10am,2:30pm,English as a New Language,,,11109,QUEENS,40.744753,-73.957971,402,26,1,4000019,4000180001,Hunters Point-Sunnyside-West Maspeth,Spanish,,"Yes-30Q312,30Q868",,,,Algebra I,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30,40.744368,-73.957177

To achieve this the school administers accelerated courses which focus on key mathematical concepts, critical thinking, written, and verbal communication skills. Students will graduate with credit on the Algebra I and Living Environment Regents and the Spanish Proficiency Exam. The Academy provides a large menu of elective club classes to further student proficiency in areas of interest. Examples of clubs are the guitar club, hydroponic club, movie club, Latin dance club, robotics club, and the chess club. PS122 believes that it is imperative to support our student's social emotional learning.

Our school is a place where all students are held to high expectations, and are pushed to be the best they can be. Our students understand that hard work always pays off, and we ensure that all students are challenged. We have a Dual Language program so that students can become fluent in both Spanish and English.  We are a ""Kids at Hope"" school, a place in which all teachers, staff and community members believe that all children can achieve success, no exceptions. In a caring, warm school environment, our students are comfortable taking risks. Our students go on many wonderful trips around NYC to visit the Statue of Liberty, attend a Major League Baseball game, or take a walking tour of Chinatown. Many of our classrooms are filled with interesting class pets so our students can learn about caring for animals. At PS/IS 384 we want our parents to feel supported, so the school has an open door policy, and parents are welcome to come in and speak with the principal or teachers at any time.",Bushwick,"242 Cooper Street, Brooklyn, NY 11207",Partially Accessible,718-642-4890,,{'url': 'https://www.myschools.nyc/en/schools/middle-school/13019'},L to Wilson Ave,"B20, B26",K384Z,Frances E.
