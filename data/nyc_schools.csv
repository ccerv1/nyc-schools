By providing many venues for our students to develop as scholars and people, ranging from our core curriculum in which all of our 8th graders take Algebra, the Mandarin Language Proficiency Exam and experience a curriculum full of reading writing and discussion, there is something to challenge every student.  In coding, students design their own video games.  In basketball, volleyball, chess and other sports, they learn to work as a team.  Through their trips to the Poconos and Washington D.C., they learn to expand their horizons beyond the city limits. In addition to pushing our students academically, we teach our children positive social and emotional skills.  Our advisory programs uses the principles of restorative justice to help students learn from their mistakes rather than just be punished by them.  Our Student Government and GSA provide ways for students to take leadership in our school.

By embracing academic rigor, student voice, collaboration, self-direction, and empathy, our students will have the confidence, tenacity and skills for success. We pride ourselves on our small, tight-knit community in which every adult knows every child and helps support their growth throughout their three years of middle school. To do this, we utilize our smaller class sizes to provide students with individualized and small group instruction. Our advisory periods allow us for daily check-ins, and the reinforcement of your core values to help our students build strong bonds and respectful relationships with their peers through Restorative Practices.

Teachers work with curriculum developers to design games that build academic and social skills. In ELA courses, students use table games to debate the strength of evidence; in math, students use a card game, Absolute Dash, to mix and match integer operations to gain the most points. All students have small group advisory twice a week to build community and promote social-emotional learning. As they build skills, students demonstrate their learning through collaborative, creative projects, taking a variety of roles from newscast producer to Revolutionary War spy to roller-coaster architect. We make learning challenging. At the end of each semester, middle school students participate in week-long design competitions. Instead of regular classes, students work in groups of 12 to create projects such as fashion shows, restaurants, and newspapers. We are inclusive in how we accept students into our school -- we do not screen. We are also inclusive in our programming within our walls -- we do not place students in high, medium, or low classes.

During their three years of middle school we seek to challenge students to think creatively, solve challenges, and engage with peers to build connection and share ideas and experiences.  At LMC students take four arts courses: Digital Arts, Dance, Music, and Visual Arts and have the opportunity engage with the art course to which they feel the greatest connection.  Every day our students begin in a small advisory group of 10-12 of their peers.  Led by one of their teachers, our advisory curriculum explores such topics as goal-setting, identity, values, service, and human rights.  Our advisories serve as a structure around which we plan the many field trips in which our students participate throughout the year, including overnight trips.  In advisory we also prepare students for the opportunity of ""out lunch"" for which students in good academic standing are eligible after the first trimester of 6th grade.

M247 Dual Language Middle School,"The mission of Dual Language Middle School (DLMS) is to support a dual language instructional model which promotes academic excellence and is built upon student strengths and curiosities. We believe that students who love languages can learn best through the dual language structure. Students are encouraged to question, challenge, make real decisions, and work collaboratively to solve problems. Through a rigorous project-directed, theme-based curriculum, children learn that school is a place to develop respect for self and others. Our mission is founded on the premise that we must experience an atmosphere of trust, safety, security, and personal attention in order to develop emotional and intellectual growth.   At DLMS, each student is assigned an advisor to help them and their families navigate the middle school experiences.

Our students travel and get real-life experience to support what they are learning in class. Students at AFL can take advantage of our top-ranked athletic program; science, technology and arts-based elective courses; and advisory program.

At Hamilton Grange success looks different for each of us. For some, it is starring in our 55-piece band, our school musical, or painting on one of our famous murals. For others it is participating in a combination of activities that include academic success in our classrooms, and competing as members of one of our 12 athletic teams (soccer, basketball, baseball, softball, boxing, track, bouldering, and hiking). We pride ourselves on providing myriad opportunities to our students through over 28 school day electives like spoken word poetry, debate, engineering, theater, and newspaper, and supporting academic success through culturally responsive teaching practices. We have earned local and national recognition for our students' academic growth and our progressive approach to discipline - we use restorative practices rather than detentions or suspensions.

At APR learning is a real world experience where teachers care beyond learning and students develop a purpose. Teachers will create culturally relevant student centered active learning experiences with real world connections, which will lead to more student engagement as well as an increase of academic discourse.  Furthermore, teacher's lessons will include higher order questioning techniques which will lead to greater student led discussions along with continuous assessment throughout the lesson to inform feedback and next steps. Priorities include creating and maintaining an inclusive environment for all students, focusing on Core Beliefs about how students learn best and all students learn in different ways,  improving student attendance, improving teacher effectiveness, improving student achievement through identified standards and increasing parental involvement.

Students enjoy the small learning environment which provides them with both individual and group experiences.  They also benefit from block programming (75-minute periods) and looping philosophy (students have the same content teachers for all three years), which allows teachers to understand and support students' strengths and simultaneously address their needs.  Additionally, technology is incorporated into all content areas, creating a hands-on approach that students benefit from.  Students also enjoy our incentive trips, our extensive after-school program, and our thriving sports program.  Parents appreciate our online grading system that is accessible anywhere at any time via internet or text message to monitor their child's academic progress.

Our curriculum develops well-rounded students who are challenged and engaged. The teachers are readying students to creatively and critically think, become self-disciplined, and develop social responsibility through high quality driven instruction. Students are challenged to question, problem-solve, communicate, and assume personal responsibility. We are an empowering and nurturing school community of diverse and collaborative members dedicated to achieving high standards for all of our students.

We will utilize this passion for learning and educate the whole person by providing a wide variety of academic challenges and expose the student to diverse, non-academic activities: Culture Day, participation in plays through Disney Jr., monthly Scholars Math Challenge. We improve staff practice and student performance by consistent reflection, feedback and evaluation. Additionally, we will create a culture that recognizes and celebrates achievement.

We offer honors programs for those students who like to be challenged and engage in high level learning.  We also offer a STEAM program which engages students in project based learning and thematic units to integrate all content areas. This program allows students who learn in a more hands on manner to engage with the content in a less traditional manner. Next, we have a dual language program for those students who are native Spanish speakers and for those who wish to better their understanding and speaking of Spanish. In addition, we offer our new arrival students an ENL program which provides the opportunity for students of diverse cultures to learn about each other and improve their English.   We also offer regents programs for select 8th grade students.  Students in these classes are eligible to take the living environment regents and Algebra 1 regents to gain high school credit in these content areas.

We partner with young people and their families to support their development into thoughtful, informed, caring and productive adults. The values of hard work, personal responsibility and compassion are the foundation of our community of learners and leaders.  MS 118 houses three academically-focused academies to meet the diverse needs of middle school students: The Honors Academies at MS 118: Pace & Spectrum and the Academy of Excellence. This design allows staff and students to benefit from the advantages of smaller learning communities inside a larger building.

Because it is such a small school, students are able to form meaningful relationships with at least one school staff that is able to support with the many changes that come with being a middle school student. The school offers two majors, dance and art, to each student which they likely auditioned for before being admitted. Students become familiar with the different art forms, and are taken to multiple trips each school year to places like the apollo theatre, Alvin Ailey, and many more. In addition, we have our MMCC ""Trendsetters"" afterschool program that exposes, and nurtures student's understanding of theatre, Drama, choir, rap/hip-hop, music production, cooking, and other extracurricular activities. We have great custodians who work tirelessly to keep our school as clean and bright. Early September you can see and smell the fresh paint on the walls.

Our focus on culturally responsive teaching and curriculum fosters an inclusive environment where all students can advance academically, socially, and emotionally. To support with the transition to middle school, we offer all incoming sixth graders the opportunity to attend our Summer Summit program during the last week of August. The goal of the program is to acclimate students and families to the middle school experience and unique opportunities at Bronx Green. During the school year, all students have access to technology based instruction via the use of Chromebooks, iPads, iPad Minis, and two fully equipped computer labs. Through our College Access for All affiliation, our students enjoy the college experience by visiting colleges/universities located in- and out-of-state by the end of seventh grade.

At FLHMS, we believe that work in school should not only help students master the standards for each grade, but should also be relevant to their lives and represent authentic opportunities to use their knowledge and skills to make a difference in the community. Each student builds a portfolio over their three years at FLHMS, presenting selected pieces from the portfolio and Roundtables twice a year in each grade for feedback from other students, teachers, and family and community members.

This means that our compassionate veteran teachers can form meaningful relationships with students and parents on the journey towards success. We can give each child our full attention to ensure they receive whatever services, programs, or activities they need to grow. ACCION stands for ""Achievement, Community, Consciousness, Integrity, Opportunity Now!"" Our family-oriented school community fosters the highest levels of achievement, mentoring, and service.

All students learn to play a musical instrument thanks to funding from the VH1 Save the Music Foundation. All of our students receive an opportunity to graduate with high school Regents credits in math, science, and foreign language. They also have a personal planner, access to online Jupiter Gradebook to monitor academic progress, a school email address, and opportunities to learn chess and to travel out of the state of New York. In 2013, our students traveled to Washington, DC to witness the presidential inauguration. Our students also travel to Vermont every school year to participate in Farms for City Kids. We offer three distinct programs for our students: STEM Institute, Liberal Arts Institute, and Arts Institute.

Our College Prep curriculum is designed to provide a wide array of content and extra curricular experiences: We provide three years of Visual Arts programming in drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture, and ceramics. Theater Arts is embedded into the Language Arts curriculum and provides students the opportunity to attend professional performances each year and create performances of their own. Our Science curriculum focuses on hands-on experimentation and provides the opportunity to receive high school credit and participate in Saturday Science enrichment through our NYU Tandon School of Engineering. In technology class students will experience three years of training in computer programming, engineering, robotics, and digital citizenship.

The school utilizes Restorative Justice practices to resolve any behavior concerns. All grades receive visual arts class. 7th and 8th graders receive Spanish instruction several times a week. All students are given advisory periods where they can monitor their academic progress and receive guidance from their advisors. During these periods, advisors also support any social-emotional concerns for students. Twice a year, students engage in an explorations unit where they conduct inquiry based research around a topic of interest. For example, the 6th graders have researched, ""What is courage?"" Students engage in workshops around the topic, take field trips, and experience guest speakers who are professional experts in the fields of study. Culminating group projects are completed and presented to parents during our Explorations Expo. All students participate in our school's science fair, which is supported through our affiliation with Urban Advantage.

Supported by dedicated teaching staff, administration, and PTA, students are provided with opportunities to engage in hands-on, inquiry-based curriculum while constructing knowledge within a meaningful context. Our Exploration Program is an outgrowth of our school's philosophy: middle school students are social individuals and benefit from learning through cooperative groups. The Exploration experience provides students with the opportunity to get off-site and explore city-wide educational institutions. Students have arts (music, theater, dace, and visual art) and technology for all three years. Our advisory program supports students' academic, social, and emotional learning, and we employ restorative practices across our school. Our free after-school program allows students to learn new skills and share common interests, through sports, arts, and leadership.

Our students see themselves and their communities represented widely in the history they study, the books and texts they read, and the expeditions they engage in.  We are committed to small class sizes of approximately 25 students.  Smaller class sizes support richer student learning.  Our students use the city as their classroom.  Fieldwork is a regular part of learning at Brooklyn Collaborative: students regularly meet with experts, tour neighborhoods and museums, analyze artifacts, collect lab samples, and more.  We are committed to developing the social and emotional self as well as the academic self through Crew.  In crew (a daily advisory class), students learn to be agents of self-change, to take responsibility for their learning, and to develop supportive relationships with adults and peers.  We are a Grades 6-12 school with a 100% college acceptance rate and a NYS Regents waiver.

Our very small middle school offers students the opportunity to grow and learn with classmates from diverse backgrounds within an engaging setting. Teachers accustomed to heterogeneous classrooms provide students a variety of individual and group learning experiences. Once a week, students meet in circles to strengthen the community of the classroom by learning more about each other, practicing active listening skills, playing group games, and exploring their social and emotional interests.

We maintained the top place for English Language Arts and Math for the past five years in District 16. We also received a Well-developed rating for all 10 indicators on the 2019 Quality Review.  Our school community ascribes to the philosophy that all students can and will learn. However, we understand some students learn faster than others and therefore provide the necessary supports to students who need it. Our school community works relentlessly to ensure all students will be successful in high school college and beyond.  We offer them high school Regents classes in middle school. There are enrichment periods where students pursue their passions such as basketball, culinary arts, cosmetology, robotics, to name a few. We are indeed so proud of our male and female basketball players as we are of our debaters who represent us well in their competitions.

At ENYMSE, our motto is ""Success Without Excuses,"" and our scholars are held to that expectation every day. Scholars are able to pursue their education in a nurturing environment. Our school just completed construction of a state-of-the-art science lab. Scholars experience STEM units in both math and science courses. We enrich these programs through strategic partnerships and trips for our scholars. All of our scholars are involved in an array of clubs and teams allowing them to explore pursuits outside of their academic interest.

We provide a positive and supportive learning environment that challenges students to think, explore, and create as they connect rigorous academic experiences with robust arts education while including choices such as sports and computer science. Students receive individualized instruction whether they have learning disability or are part of our Gifted and Talented program. Our students are exposed to a variety of the arts in grade 6 and 7, such as visual art, dance, theater (including a Broadway show), and music. In grade 8, our students will focus their study on an art of their choosing to develop their individual skills. At Legacy School of the Arts, we believe that social-emotional development is as important as academic development; all students will be part of a small group advisory led by their mentor.

STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) is an inter-disciplinary style of learning that is student-centered, and project-based. Students at M.S. 935 will learn by doing through scientific inquiry, the Engineering Design Process, and innovation skills. The curriculum provides practice in problem solving, discovery exploration, and collaboration, facilitating student understanding of real-world applications of science and engineering. We emphasize design and creativity to give students the freedom to apply critical thinking and cross disciplinary tools, in order to ask questions and solve problems that relate to the world they live in.

We offer all students access to specialized classes including the Living Environment and Algebra Regents.  Students can choose a specialty class and follow their passion.  Some of our highlighted specialties include Zoology, Robotics/Aviation, and Musical Theater.  In addition, we offer after school programs including Chess, Debate Club, Broadway Jr., and athletic teams such as Soccer, Volleyball, Basketball, and Track.   At Seth Low, we are also proud of our focus on Social Emotional Learning.

Our staff believes in the importance of addressing the needs of the ""Whole Child"".  We have key partnerships with institutions such as the Center for Arts Educations and Arts Engaged. This allows teachers to team up with artists and use an arts integration approach to teach core content.  We also partner with higher education institutions such as Stony Brooks and CUNY to bring the concept of News Literacy to life.  We offer a SIGMA program where those who graduate from it receive credit for Two High School Regents courses (Algebra and Earth Science). In our Student Owned Classrooms, one teacher provides direct instruction to students for most of the core subjects. We create a student friendly, safe environment where the needs of the student are primary. We have a plethora of activities and After School Programs that offer academic support, academic achievement and promote social, emotional development.

Every student has access to a full-time academic counselor, a vibrant and diverse arts program, and meaningful after-school activities. Teachers utilize online academic enrichment programs (Achieve3000 & iReady Math), to collect data that informs instruction, which leads to improved ELA and math skills. Through our Schoolwide Enrichment Model (SEM), students develop skills, foster positive relationships, and experience social growth. Our enrichment clusters, as well as our embedded organizational skills program, promote creativity and collaboration, in support of college- and career- readiness and community service. In partnership with staff, families, and the community, we foster the emotional, social, and intellectual growth of our students, in order to prepare them to reach their full academic potential and become outstanding citizens.",Georgetown,"1420 East  68 Street, Brooklyn, NY 11234",Not Accessible,(718( 763-4701,www.RoyHMann.com,{'url': 'https://www.myschools.nyc/en/schools/middle-school/11497'},,"B100, B3, B41, B46, B47, BM1",K078A,Roy H.

There are laptop carts in every single learning space, including the cafeteria which look more like a restaurant than a typical lunch room.  At Brownsville Collaborative Middle School of Agriculture and Technology, we have two Hydroponic Labs where Scholars grow lettuce, kale, herbs, cucumbers, tomatoes and peppers on a daily basis.

Teachers regularly update parents about student progress and parents can access their child's grades and assignments on the internet. We have a Parent University that provides workshops and opportunities for parents to play an active role in their child's education and each student is involved in community service activities through their advisory groups.

The social-emotional development of our scholars is that of utmost importance to us here at Mott Hall Bridges Academy. Programs such as She Is Me, I Matter & A Tribe Called US, are all geared towards their personal development. All scholars are also apart of four different Houses that instill friendly competition within our building. Monthly events such as Spelling Bees, Step Competitions, Math Bowl, Poetry Slam & Bridges Got Talent Show are all ways that we create the strong culture at our school. Students present quarterly performances with our Community Spotlight elective classes. Here at MHBA, we have a niche for every scholar. Our Athletic Department is also an active part of what makes our school unique.

Students are able to select up to two talent activities each school year. I.S. 61 has created five academies within the main school that foster a nurturing environment for our students. Each academy is set up with its own dean, guidance counselor, assistant principal, and staff of teachers, therefore creating a small learning community. Parents are also able to track their child's progress for each unit through a special Engrade account. To support our efforts to assist students in meeting the standards for college- and career-readiness, parents have an option to select our AGP program for their child. Students are expected to maintain an 85 GPA as well as take all Regents offered by the school.

We are a small, inclusive school supporting all students through co-taught classes, many with 1:13 class ratios, allowing significant individual support. Students take three additional periods of Math and ELA per week to support high achievement and college readiness. Students take Japanese, Korean, and Chinese. Our school culture embraces our four pillars: honor, excellence, curiosity, and celebration. We pride ourselves on a positive, safe school environment through our anti-bullying program, Rachel's Challenge, advisory, school clubs, and student government. Our parent coordinator and on-site translators keep parents informed through a newsletter, calendar, and monthly First Fridays (parents are invited into EWSIS classes for the day). Assignments, grades, and attendance are available on Pupilpath.

(South Asian Youth Action), which is an after school program serving many of our students. We emphasize the importance of college by being a partner with the DOE's College Access for All initiative. This program builds college-consciousness in our seventh grade students to support better decision making in grade eight through high school. Parents also have the option to enroll their children in South Asian Youth Action camp (SAYA!). This provides students the necessary after school support via social and emotional opportunities. As a result of our expanding Arts programs, our students are fortunate to showcase their talent at Queens College, as well as Carnegie Hall as participants of an honors band program. Our Visual Arts students have won the Queens Borough Arts Festival two years in a row, resulting in the winning pieces being displayed at the Queens Museum.

At MS 210, we have high expectations for all of our students.  Here at MS 210, we have five career academies: Academy of Engineering and Architecture, Academy of Graphic Arts and Computer Science, Academy of Health Professions, Academy of Visual and Performing Arts and Academy of Law and Humanities.  Although we have five different academies, we are one school where the students will have the opportunity to interact with students from the other academies. MS 210 also offers students the opportunity to take Regents classes in the 8th grade if they demonstrate the ability to maintain high grades in accelerated classes. MS 210 also believes that the students benefit from the arts programs.  We have recently expanded this department to include theatre, dance and music.  All students have the opportunity to audition for the school play, which incorporates singing, dancing, acting, as well as stage directing.",Ozone Park,"93-11 101 Avenue, Queens, NY 11416",Partially Accessible,718-845-5942,ms210q.schoolwires.net,{'url': 'https://www.myschools.nyc/en/schools/middle-school/12175'},A to Rockaway Blvd,"Q11, Q112, Q21, Q24, Q37, Q41, Q52, Q53, Q7, Q8, QM15",Q210Z,Elizabeth Blackwell (J.H.S. 210),Zoned,375,87,1,1,114,476,N,N,Open to students residing in the zone,,,97,41,37,Richmond Hill High School,John Adams High School,63,1808,6-8,8:20am,2:40pm,English as a New Language,"Advisory, Art, Band, Dance, Fine Arts, Foreign Language, Guitar, Library, Performing Arts, Physical Education, Regents Living Environment, Spanish, Theater, Urban Advantage, US History",Dance,11416,QUEENS,40.683858,-73.84747,409,32,38,4188567,4090670001,Woodhaven,Spanish;Other Language,"Book Club, Dance, Peer Mediation, Student Council, Theater, Champs: Sports",,,"High School for Construction Trades, Engineering and Architecture",Summer Session,"English,Spanish,US History,Algebra I,Living Environment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27.0,40.68476,-73.847633

Some features that support our college-going culture include development of the school character traits: Community, Perseverance, Collaboration, and Leadership; student-led conferences twice a year; the school-wide  independent reading program; collaborative study groups and student to student dialogue in each class; being an AVID Showcase School; and being a pilot school for College Access For All in 2014.  Academic values include developing communication, research, and problem-solving skills in each of our students.  Instruction is differentiated, giving all students the direction and support needed to master these skills and engage in rigorous content on a daily basis.",South Ozone Park,"121-10 Rockaway Boulevard, Queens, NY 11420",Partially Accessible,718-659-3792,www.hcms297.org,{'url': 'https://www.myschools.nyc/en/schools/middle-school/12196'},,"Q10, Q37, Q7, Q9, QM18",Q297U,Hawtree Creek Middle School,Open,311,74,4,4,20,85,Y,Y,Open to students residing in the zone,,,99,44,38,Hillcrest High School,Thomas A.

Our students are confident, and are able to express their thinking and reasoning in a variety of ways.  They are self-motivated learners capable of making strategic choices that will impact themselves, their families, communities, as well as present and future generations. All our scholars leave IS 59, with a balance of academic and interpersonal skills they will need to carve out their own place in the world.  As we move towards becoming a STEAM School (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math), we offer a rigorous academic program along with dance, visual arts, chorus, and drama.  We host a wide variety of clubs.  They include Volley Ball, Basketball, Student Government, I.S. 59 Young Ambassadors Club, and Debate Club.  Our Rising Stars Academy is a coveted accelerated program that engages our scholars in the Future Problem Solvers Program.

We offer various early high school opportunities through Regents courses in Living Environment, Algebra 1, and (by 2021) U.S. History.  QUMS is the only District 29 official site for preparation and administration of the Specialized High School Exam (SHSAT).  In other words, students take the Specialized High School Exam at our school during the school day in the Fall.

We work to expose students to multiple opportunities inside and outside of the classroom. With the incorporation of multiple community partnerships, we expose our students to various career opportunities. The focus is not simply to promote students to the next grade, but to prepare them for the rest of their lives. In addition to personalizing students' academic experiences, our talented teachers share their various abilities by leading clubs such as dance, robotics, chess, debate, and even a learning to be  a disc jockey (DJ). We are expanding our entrepreneurial vision by introducing our CoVo Shark Tank where students get to pitch their business ideas and receive funding and guidance to conduct their businesses within the school community. Our school is the perfect place for students to grow by learning from their mistakes, capitalizing on their strengths, and transitioning to the young adulthood stage of their lives.",Springfield Gardens,"145-00 Springfield Boulevard, Queens, NY 11413",Not Accessible,718-977-6180,www.sites.google.com/ms356covo.org/covofamilysite/,{'url': 'https://www.myschools.nyc/en/schools/middle-school/12526'},,"Q111, Q113, Q114, Q3, Q77, Q85",Q356U,Community Voices Middle School,Open,149,48,2,3,15,85,N,N,Open to students and residents of District 29,Priority to residents of the middle school zone,Then to District 29 students and residents,80,28,17,Excelsior Preparatory High School,,68,340,6-8,8:10am,2:30pm,English as a New Language,"Advisory, Algebra I, Art, Book Club, Chess, Chorus, Computer Science, Dance, Fitness, Foreign Language, LEGO Robotics, Library, Living Environment, Math, Mindfulness, Music, Peer Mediation, Photography, Physical Education, Piano, Regents Living Environment, Robotics, Saturday Academy, Science, Spanish, STEM, Stock Market, Student Council, Technology, Urban Advantage, Yearbook","Basketball, Fitness Club",11413,QUEENS,40.664608,-73.758784,413,31,320,4285682,4133310001,Springfield Gardens South-Brookville,Spanish,"Art, Book Club, Chess, Coding, Dance, Drama, Fitness, Leadership, Lego Robotics, Music, Peer Mediation, Photography, Restorative Circles, Robotics, Saturday Academy, School Newspaper, Service Learning, Spelling Bee, STEM, Step Team, Student Council, Talent Show, Technology, Theater, Tutoring",Yes-29Q231,,,"Extended Day,Summer Session,Weekend Program,Uniform","Algebra I,Living Environment,Earth Science",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,29.0,40.664809,-73.759396

Our students attend monthly Broadway shows, put on 3 concerts, and have won city titles in both Debate and Boys Varsity Basketball.

We have increased our partnerships with community-based organizations to support students and families. Some of these strategic partnerships include the YMCA, Big Brother Big Sister Literacy Program, Seamen's Society for Children, GirlÃÂÃÂ UniverCITY, SUNDOG Theatre, 21st Century Community Learning Centers, Salvation Army, the Jewish Community Center, Urban Advantage, Safe Passages, Liberty Partnership, and the Jewish Board.

As a Community School, we have the benefit of a full-time CBO, Wediko Children's Services, whose staff assists us with meeting the social-emotional needs of our students.  Together with our well-established HAWKS parent-teacher association, IS 291 is a community of learners and champions for children.

We hope to build on the gains and performance made by this teacher team to infuse both math and science as well. We currently have residencies and partnerships with prestigious organizations such as the Center for Arts Education and the Urban Arts Partnership.  Our school hosts numerous arts exhibitions and shows throughout the year as well as provide off-site family trips to prestigious institutions such as the Lincoln Center for Ballet. We also provide Arts instruction for our families during numerous workshops.  We hope to extend our residencies so that even more exposure to the arts is offered.
